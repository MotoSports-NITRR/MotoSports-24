        engineering design competition in which students from colleges and universities all over the country, compete with a life-size formula-style vehicle in areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance. The series replicates the global student Formula series hosted in around
        <span className="text-red-700"> 11 countries  </span> per year.
        The purpose of this competition is to encourage students to gain hands-on practical experience, while applying engineering theories studied in the classroom. In addition, students learn the art of management and teamwork, which are essential skills required in the
        <span className="text-red-700"> real world. </span> These student teams are required to build a new vehicle from scratch year-after-year and seek sponsorship and donations by their own means to fund the project.
